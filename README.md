3d Printed solar driven IoT interactive led eyes for Halloween

# To Print
Print a pair of eyes at a time. Add a post processing pause into your g-code to pause at the layer just before the light openings are closed up. During the pause, thread the lights through the holes and flatten them against the bottom. Then resume your print, allowing the printer to seal the lights into the print.
